Welcome to the Parking System project repository! This C project offers a comprehensive solution for managing a parking lot

This is a console-based parking stand management system written in C. The application allows users to park vehicles of different types (bus, car, bike, and auto) and provides functionalities to check for parked vehicles, display today's insight, and exit the system.

Features:

Park a vehicle: Users can choose the vehicle type and provide necessary details such as customer name, vehicle number, and date. The system checks for available parking slots and issues a receipt upon successful parking.

Check for a vehicle: Users can search for a parked vehicle by providing their name and vehicle number. The system informs whether the vehicle is parked in the stand or not.

Show today's insight: The system displays insights for the current day, including total earnings and the number of each vehicle type parked.
